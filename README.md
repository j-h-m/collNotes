collNotes is an Android and iOS App, using Xamarin technology. Replaces, or supplements, a field biologist's traditional journal.

collNotes sister app [collBook](https://github.com/CapPow/collBook).

The main purpose of collNotes is to export data in a format digestible by [collBook](https://github.com/CapPow/collBook). The default export data format is Darwin Core, so it should work with many other platforms as well. 

If you have a vested interest in a certain format, please let me know! I have tried to model the data in such a way that adding new export types is quick and easy to develop and test. I would like to test this! :)
